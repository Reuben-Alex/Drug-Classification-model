# Drug-Classification-model

This project aims to classify patients into various drug categories based on features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. We use machine learning models, specifically Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, to compare their performance in classifying the correct drug category.

# Project Overview

# Dataset

The dataset includes patient data with the following features:

•	Age: Patient’s age. 

•	Sex: Gender of the patient (Male/Female). 

•	BP: Blood pressure level (High, Normal, Low). 

•	Cholesterol: Cholesterol level (High, Normal). 

•	Na_to_K: Sodium-to-potassium ratio in blood. 

•	Drug: Target column representing the type of drug prescribed to the patient.

# Objective

The goal is to classify patients into different drug categories (DrugA, DrugB, etc.) using machine learning models. We will compare the following models:

•	Naive Bayes Classifier 

•	Logistic Regression


# Performance Metrics

I have used the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the models:

•	Confusion Matrix: To show the correct and incorrect classifications for each class.

•	ROC Curve and AUC: To compare the area under the curve for each model, indicating their ability to classify patients correctly. 

•	Precision, Recall, F1-Score: To analyze the classification performance of each model across all drug classes.
